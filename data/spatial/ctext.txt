Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

The Deep Sandy Terrace site has deep sandy soils with little horizon development. This, coupled with their position on terraces, form the unique plant communities.

Soil Features
The two representative soils are Bienville and Hainesville. Both are sandy and classified as psammentic paleudalfs and lamellic quartzipsamments, respectively. The deep sands exist through all the horizons. There is very little clay percent increase as depth increases. The soils drain somewhat excessively and their permeability is moderate to moderately rapid.

Reference Community
The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Ground cover is sparse and much of the surface is bare ground or covered by lichens. Common understory species include: little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern prickley pear (Opuntia humifosa), tapered rosette grass (Dichanthelium acuminatum), and Texas bullnettle (Cnidoscolus texana). Shrub species will be sparse as well, but include: yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum).

Shortleaf pine and bluejack oak comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence of shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 50 and 90 percent. Bluejacks have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent of the overall canopy structure. Other overstory trees are sometimes found colonizing the areas in lesser amounts (less than 10 percent), including hickory (Carya sp.) and upland oaks (Quercus sp.). Oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), winged sumac (Rhus copallinum) and bluejack saplings are extremely common in the mid-story layer. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis).

Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
Alazan, Attoyac, and Bernaldo are representative soils of the Terraces. The Terraces can have a wide range of textures and depths. The grouping factor is, all are located on the terrace landform position.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Although both the woodland suitability group symbol and the woodland ordination symbol are based upon site index, the symbols are different and do not correlate well with one another. Different methods were used to arrive at the symbols. The woodland ordination symbol was developed in 1985 to replace the older woodland suitability group.
The first part of the woodland suitability symbol, a number, indicates the potential productivity of the soils for important trees. The number 1 indicates very high productivity; 2, high; 3, moderate high; 4, moderate; and 5, low.

The letter x indicates stoniness or rockiness; w, excessive water in or on the soil; t, toxic substances in the soil; d, restricted root depth; c, clay in the upper part of the soil; s, sandy texture; f, high content of coarse fragments in the soil profile; and r, steep slopes. The letter o indicates that limitations or restrictions are insignificant. If a soil has more than one limitation, the priority is as follows: x, w, t, d, c, s, f, and r.

The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Shortleaf pine and bluejack oak comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence of shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 50 and 90 percent. Bluejacks have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent of the overall canopy structure. Other overstory trees are sometimes found colonizing the areas in lesser amounts (less than 10 percent), including hickory (Carya sp.) and upland oaks (Quercus sp.). Oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), winged sumac (Rhus copallinum) and bluejack saplings are extremely common in the mid-story layer. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities. Indicator plants include Texas bullnettle (Cnidosolus texanus) Gulf Coast yucca (Yucca louisianesis), Pickering's dawnflower (Stylisma pickereringii), and nettleleaf noseburn (Tragia urticioflia).

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult.

Shortleaf pine and bluejack oak comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence of shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 50 and 90 percent. Bluejacks have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent of the overall canopy structure. Other overstory trees are sometimes found colonizing the areas in lesser amounts (less than 10 percent), including hickory (Carya sp.) and upland oaks (Quercus sp.). Oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), winged sumac (Rhus copallinum) and bluejack saplings are extremely common in the mid-story layer. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities. Indicator plants include Texas bullnettle (Cnidosolus texanus) Gulf Coast yucca (Yucca louisianesis), Pickering's dawnflower (Stylisma pickereringii), and nettleleaf noseburn (Tragia urticioflia).

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons.

The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Shortleaf pine and bluejack oak comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence of shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 50 and 90 percent. Bluejacks have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent of the overall canopy structure. Other overstory trees are sometimes found colonizing the areas in lesser amounts (less than 10 percent), including hickory (Carya sp.) and upland oaks (Quercus sp.). Oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), winged sumac (Rhus copallinum) and bluejack saplings are extremely common in the mid-story layer. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities. Indicator plants include Texas bullnettle (Cnidosolus texanus) Gulf Coast yucca (Yucca louisianesis), Pickering's dawnflower (Stylisma pickereringii), and nettleleaf noseburn (Tragia urticioflia).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface.

The first gleyed-subsurface horizon usually appears within 8 to 11 inches. The gleying and other redoximorphic features continue through the profile usually past 80 inches. Gleying and redoximorphic features are caused by prolonged inundation. The sites are very flat with slopes from 0 to 1 percent. Other soils correlated to this site include: Amy, Angelina, Bibb, Bleakwood, Dreka, Groom, Guyton, Kanebreak, Mathiston, Mattex, Nahatche, Pophers, Sardis, Marietta, Mooreville, Ochlockonee, and Socagee.

The Loamy Bottomland system communities are based highly on micro-relief throughout the landscape. A subtle rise or fall of mere inches can drastically alter the vegetative composition. The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3. Plant species occurring in the willow oak community are usually facultative wet according to the U.S. Army Corps' Wetland Delineation Manual (2010). Understory indicators include blunt broom sedge (Carex tribuloides), smallspike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and American Buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata).

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
Alazan, Attoyac, and Bernaldo are representative soils of the Terraces. The Terraces can have a wide range of textures and depths. The grouping factor is, all are located on the terrace landform position.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface.

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult.

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are frequently flooded. The site is typically flooded for brief to long periods during normal rainfall years. They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community. 

Soil Features
Mattex and Manco are two of the representative soils of the Loamy Bottomlands. This ecological site formed from loamy alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable loamy entisols on bottomlands. The first gleyed-subsurface horizon usually appears within 8 to 11 inches. The gleying and other redoximorphic features continue through the profile usually past 80 inches. Gleying and redoximorphic features are caused by prolonged inundation. The sites are very flat with slopes from 0 to 1 percent. Other soils correlated to this site include: Amy, Angelina, Bibb, Bleakwood, Dreka, Groom, Guyton, Kanebreak, Mathiston, Mattex, Nahatche, Pophers, Sardis, Marietta, Mooreville, Ochlockonee, and Socagee.

Reference Community
The Loamy Bottomland system communities are based highly on micro-relief throughout the landscape. A subtle rise or fall of mere inches can drastically alter the vegetative composition. The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis).

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii).

Ecological Site Concept
The Deep Sandy Terrace site has deep sandy soils with little horizon development. This, coupled with their position on terraces, form the unique plant communities.

Soil Features
The two representative soils are Bienville and Hainesville. Both are sandy and classified as psammentic paleudalfs and lamellic quartzipsamments, respectively. The deep sands exist through all the horizons. There is very little clay percent increase as depth increases. The soils drain somewhat excessively and their permeability is moderate to moderately rapid.

Reference Community
The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Ground cover is sparse and much of the surface is bare ground or covered by lichens. Common understory species include: little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern prickley pear (Opuntia humifosa), tapered rosette grass (Dichanthelium acuminatum), and Texas bullnettle (Cnidoscolus texana). Shrub species will be sparse as well, but include: yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum).

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis).

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches. Besides the Briley series, Darbonne, Larue, Lilbert, Rentzel, Rosalie, Tenaha, Trep, and Wolfpen are correlated to the ecological site.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pine trees comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence in the overstory on any given site is between 75 to 100 percent. Blackjack and post oaks have established on some sites, comprising up to 20 percent of the overall canopy structure. Farkleberry, winged sumac (Rhus copallinum), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), sassafras (Sassafras albidium), and oak saplings are common in the mid-story layer, increasing in abundance with time since last fire. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with sometimes large accumulations of plant litter, 15 to 45 percent. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities, at times seemingly dominating the entire area. Indicator forbs include Virginia tephrosia (Tephrosia virginiana), St. Andrew's cross (Hypericum hypericoides), Nuttall's wild indigo (Baptistia nuttalliana), and Atlanta pigeonwings (Clitoria mariana).

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are occasionally flooded. The sites will typically stay flooded longest during the periods of November to May. Due to their coarse textured soils, the sites drain quicker and do not stay flooded as long as the loamy and clayey bottomlands sites. The drainage patterns and sandy soils create their unique plant community.

Soil Features
The ecological site formed from alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, entisols and inceptisols on bottomlands. These sites differ from the loamy and clayey bottomlands by having coarse textured, sandy soils. Their drainage is comparatively better and the soils do not stay as saturated as their other bottomland coutnerparts. Soils correlated to this site include: Henco, Kawah, Keechi, Lotus, Melhomes, Naconiche, Nugent, and Osier. 

Reference Community
Shrub and herbaceous understory species will be tolerant of flooding and dense shade from the overstory canopy. Common shrub species include: mayhaw (Crataegus opaca), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and possumhaw (Ilex decidua).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches. Besides the Briley series, Darbonne, Larue, Lilbert, Rentzel, Rosalie, Tenaha, Trep, and Wolfpen are correlated to the ecological site.

The Woodland phase (1.1) is the first community in the State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally sparse. The overstory canopy is not as dominated by shortleaf pine as the adjacently surrounding sites. Instead, the shortleaf is interspersed with post oak, blackjack oak, bluejack oak, and black hickory (Carya texana). The occurrence of either post oak or shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 10 and 50 percent. Bluejack oak and blackjack oak have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent, and black hickory ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. In most other ecological sites, oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Conversely, in the Very Deep Sandy Uplands, the pine layer and the oak layer are similar in height. The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Both communities are characterized by a sparse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Threeawn can occupy much of the ground cover, as they are considered first successional grasses. The lack of nutrients and water holding capactiy make colonization possible by species able to withstand the harsh conditions. Little bluestem (Schizachrium scoparium) and panic-grasses (Dichanthelium sp.) may be common, but not abundant.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant.

Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities.

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are occasionally flooded. The sites will typically stay flooded longest during the periods of November to May. Due to their coarse textured soils, the sites drain quicker and do not stay flooded as long as the loamy and clayey bottomlands sites. The drainage patterns and sandy soils create their unique plant community.

Soil Features
The ecological site formed from alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, entisols and inceptisols on bottomlands. These sites differ from the loamy and clayey bottomlands by having coarse textured, sandy soils. Their drainage is comparatively better and the soils do not stay as saturated as their other bottomland coutnerparts.

Ecological Site Concept
The Very Deep Sandy Uplands site has deep sandy soils greater than 80 inches with little horizon development. The upland landscape, coupled with properties associated with the depth of the sand, forms its unique plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands throughout the entire soil profile, measured to 80 inches. Being entisols, below the A horizon, the B horizons are not well developed. They are instead characterized mainly by a change in color, not the typical clay accumulations of most other upland soils throughout the MLRA. The Tonkawa series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, excessively drained, permeable soils that formed in sandy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits of the Carizzo Sand, Queen City Sand, and Sparta Sand Formations. The series is classified as a Thermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamment. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep sands throughout all horizons. Besides the Tonkawa series, Darden and Duffern are included in the Very Deep Sandy Upland ecological site.

The Woodland phase (1.1) is the first community in the State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally sparse. The overstory canopy is not as dominated by shortleaf pine as the adjacently surrounding sites. Instead, the shortleaf is interspersed with post oak, blackjack oak, bluejack oak, and black hickory (Carya texana). The occurrence of either post oak or shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 10 and 50 percent. Bluejack oak and blackjack oak have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent, and black hickory ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. In most other ecological sites, oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Conversely, in the Very Deep Sandy Uplands, the pine layer and the oak layer are similar in height. The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Both communities are characterized by a sparse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Threeawn can occupy much of the ground cover, as they are considered first successional grasses. The lack of nutrients and water holding capactiy make colonization possible by species able to withstand the harsh conditions. Little bluestem (Schizachrium scoparium) and panic-grasses (Dichanthelium sp.) may be common, but not abundant. Indicator plants include Gulf Coast yucca, Texas bullnettle (Cnidosolus texanus), Noseburns (Tragia sp.), plains snakecotton (Froelichia floridana), and Louisiana nerveray (Tetragonotheca ludoviciana).

Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant.

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Upland site is unique by its upland position on the landscape, while also having a seasonally high water table. Clay soils in the subhorizons cause water to stay in the profile for long periods of time, especially from November to May. Not only does the water table affect the plants, but many of the soils are shallow with their depth to bedrock as low as 16 inches.

Soil Features
The soils consist of shallow to very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed from mudstone residuum. The representative soils are: Alusa, Anacoco, Browndell, Colita, Corrigan, Elmina, Felker, Fetzer, Gomery, Kolin, Libuse, Lummus, Metcalf, Tiak, and Wiergate. They are widely varying taxonomically, from alfisols to ultisols to vertisols. Their unifying factor is their upland position with a fluctuating water table. Many of the soils have restrictions to bedrock, classifying them as shallow.

Reference Community
The varying degree of water availability and root restriction cause the understory sites to be highly variable. Common understory species include: longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), sedges (Carex sp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and Texas ironweed (Vernonia texana). Common shrub species include: American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium).

The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are frequently flooded. The site is typically flooded for brief to long periods during normal rainfall years. They will stay flooded starting in November and ending in May. The loamy-textured soils combined with the flooding frequency form the plant community. 

Soil Features
Mattex and Manco are two of the representative soils of the Loamy Bottomlands. This ecological site formed from loamy alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable loamy entisols on bottomlands. The first gleyed-subsurface horizon usually appears within 8 to 11 inches. The gleying and other redoximorphic features continue through the profile usually past 80 inches. Gleying and redoximorphic features are caused by prolonged inundation. The sites are very flat with slopes from 0 to 1 percent.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches.

Ecological Site Concept
The Very Deep Sandy Uplands site has deep sandy soils greater than 80 inches with little horizon development. The upland landscape, coupled with properties associated with the depth of the sand, forms its unique plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands throughout the entire soil profile, measured to 80 inches. Being entisols, below the A horizon, the B horizons are not well developed. They are instead characterized mainly by a change in color, not the typical clay accumulations of most other upland soils throughout the MLRA. The Tonkawa series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, excessively drained, permeable soils that formed in sandy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits of the Carizzo Sand, Queen City Sand, and Sparta Sand Formations. The series is classified as a Thermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamment. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep sands throughout all horizons. Besides the Tonkawa series, Darden and Duffern are included in the Very Deep Sandy Upland ecological site.

Reference Community
The Woodland phase (1.1) is the first community in the State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally sparse. The overstory canopy is not as dominated by shortleaf pine as the adjacently surrounding sites. Instead, the shortleaf is interspersed with post oak, blackjack oak, bluejack oak, and black hickory (Carya texana). The occurrence of either post oak or shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 10 and 50 percent. Bluejack oak and blackjack oak have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent, and black hickory ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. In most other ecological sites, oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Conversely, in the Very Deep Sandy Uplands, the pine layer and the oak layer are similar in height. The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Both communities are characterized by a sparse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Threeawn can occupy much of the ground cover, as they are considered first successional grasses. The lack of nutrients and water holding capactiy make colonization possible by species able to withstand the harsh conditions. Little bluestem (Schizachrium scoparium) and panic-grasses (Dichanthelium sp.) may be common, but not abundant. Indicator plants include Gulf Coast yucca, Texas bullnettle (Cnidosolus texanus), Noseburns (Tragia sp.), plains snakecotton (Froelichia floridana), and Louisiana nerveray (Tetragonotheca ludoviciana).

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Upland site is unique by its upland position on the landscape, while also having a seasonally high water table. Clay soils in the subhorizons cause water to stay in the profile for long periods of time, especially from November to May. Not only does the water table affect the plants, but many of the soils are shallow with their depth to bedrock as low as 16 inches.

Soil Features
The soils consist of shallow to very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed from mudstone residuum. The representative soils are: Alusa, Anacoco, Browndell, Colita, Corrigan, Elmina, Felker, Fetzer, Gomery, Kolin, Libuse, Lummus, Metcalf, Tiak, and Wiergate. They are widely varying taxonomically, from alfisols to ultisols to vertisols. Their unifying factor is their upland position with a fluctuating water table. Many of the soils have restrictions to bedrock, classifying them as shallow.

Reference Community
The varying degree of water availability and root restriction cause the understory sites to be highly variable. Common understory species include: longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), sedges (Carex sp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and Texas ironweed (Vernonia texana). Common shrub species include: American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches. Besides the Briley series, Darbonne, Larue, Lilbert, Rentzel, Rosalie, Tenaha, Trep, and Wolfpen are correlated to the ecological site.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pine trees comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence in the overstory on any given site is between 75 to 100 percent. Blackjack and post oaks have established on some sites, comprising up to 20 percent of the overall canopy structure. Farkleberry, winged sumac (Rhus copallinum), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), sassafras (Sassafras albidium), and oak saplings are common in the mid-story layer, increasing in abundance with time since last fire. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with sometimes large accumulations of plant litter, 15 to 45 percent. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities, at times seemingly dominating the entire area. Indicator forbs include Virginia tephrosia (Tephrosia virginiana), St. Andrew's cross (Hypericum hypericoides), Nuttall's wild indigo (Baptistia nuttalliana), and Atlanta pigeonwings (Clitoria mariana).

The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory.

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Deep Sandy Terrace site has deep sandy soils with little horizon development. This, coupled with their position on terraces, form the unique plant communities.

Soil Features
The two representative soils are Bienville and Hainesville. Both are sandy and classified as psammentic paleudalfs and lamellic quartzipsamments, respectively. The deep sands exist through all the horizons. There is very little clay percent increase as depth increases. The soils drain somewhat excessively and their permeability is moderate to moderately rapid.

Reference Community
The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Ground cover is sparse and much of the surface is bare ground or covered by lichens. Common understory species include: little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern prickley pear (Opuntia humifosa), tapered rosette grass (Dichanthelium acuminatum), and Texas bullnettle (Cnidoscolus texana).

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

The Loamy Bottomland system communities are based highly on micro-relief throughout the landscape. A subtle rise or fall of mere inches can drastically alter the vegetative composition. The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3. Plant species occurring in the willow oak community are usually facultative wet according to the U.S. Army Corps' Wetland Delineation Manual (2010). Understory indicators include blunt broom sedge (Carex tribuloides), smallspike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and American Buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata).

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments.

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are occasionally flooded. The sites will typically stay flooded longest during the periods of November to May. Due to their coarse textured soils, the sites drain quicker and do not stay flooded as long as the loamy and clayey bottomlands sites. The drainage patterns and sandy soils create their unique plant community.

Soil Features
The ecological site formed from alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, entisols and inceptisols on bottomlands. These sites differ from the loamy and clayey bottomlands by having coarse textured, sandy soils. Their drainage is comparatively better and the soils do not stay as saturated as their other bottomland coutnerparts. Soils correlated to this site include: Henco, Kawah, Keechi, Lotus, Melhomes, Naconiche, Nugent, and Osier.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface.

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches.

The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches. Besides the Briley series, Darbonne, Larue, Lilbert, Rentzel, Rosalie, Tenaha, Trep, and Wolfpen are correlated to the ecological site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Very Deep Sandy Uplands site has deep sandy soils greater than 80 inches with little horizon development. The upland landscape, coupled with properties associated with the depth of the sand, forms its unique plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands throughout the entire soil profile, measured to 80 inches. Being entisols, below the A horizon, the B horizons are not well developed. They are instead characterized mainly by a change in color, not the typical clay accumulations of most other upland soils throughout the MLRA. The Tonkawa series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, excessively drained, permeable soils that formed in sandy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits of the Carizzo Sand, Queen City Sand, and Sparta Sand Formations.

The Woodland phase (1.1) is the first community in the State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally sparse. The overstory canopy is not as dominated by shortleaf pine as the adjacently surrounding sites. Instead, the shortleaf is interspersed with post oak, blackjack oak, bluejack oak, and black hickory (Carya texana). The occurrence of either post oak or shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 10 and 50 percent. Bluejack oak and blackjack oak have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent, and black hickory ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. In most other ecological sites, oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Conversely, in the Very Deep Sandy Uplands, the pine layer and the oak layer are similar in height. The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Both communities are characterized by a sparse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Threeawn can occupy much of the ground cover, as they are considered first successional grasses. The lack of nutrients and water holding capactiy make colonization possible by species able to withstand the harsh conditions. Little bluestem (Schizachrium scoparium) and panic-grasses (Dichanthelium sp.) may be common, but not abundant. Indicator plants include Gulf Coast yucca, Texas bullnettle (Cnidosolus texanus), Noseburns (Tragia sp.), plains snakecotton (Froelichia floridana), and Louisiana nerveray (Tetragonotheca ludoviciana).

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Deep Sandy Upland site has deep, sandy-surfaced soils that gradually grade into sandy loams and sandy clay loams. The upland landscape coupled with properties associated with the depth of the sand form its unique plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles greater than 39.4 inches (100 centimeters). The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Darco series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits of the Carizzo Sand, Queen City Sand, and Sparta Sand Formations. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Grossarenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic horizon deep in the soil profile. Besides the Darco series, Betis, Flo, Grapeland, and Pickton are correlated to this site.

Shortleaf pine and bluejack oak comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence of shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 50 and 90 percent. Bluejacks have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent of the overall canopy structure. Other overstory trees are sometimes found colonizing the areas in lesser amounts (less than 10 percent), including hickory (Carya sp.) and upland oaks (Quercus sp.). Oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), winged sumac (Rhus copallinum) and bluejack saplings are extremely common in the mid-story layer. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities. Indicator plants include Texas bullnettle (Cnidosolus texanus) Gulf Coast yucca (Yucca louisianesis), Pickering's dawnflower (Stylisma pickereringii), and nettleleaf noseburn (Tragia urticioflia).

The Woodland phase (1.1) is the first community in the State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally sparse. The overstory canopy is not as dominated by shortleaf pine as the adjacently surrounding sites. Instead, the shortleaf is interspersed with post oak, blackjack oak, bluejack oak, and black hickory (Carya texana). The occurrence of either post oak or shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 10 and 50 percent. Bluejack oak and blackjack oak have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent, and black hickory ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. In most other ecological sites, oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Conversely, in the Very Deep Sandy Uplands, the pine layer and the oak layer are similar in height. The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Both communities are characterized by a sparse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Threeawn can occupy much of the ground cover, as they are considered first successional grasses. The lack of nutrients and water holding capactiy make colonization possible by species able to withstand the harsh conditions. Little bluestem (Schizachrium scoparium) and panic-grasses (Dichanthelium sp.) may be common, but not abundant. Indicator plants include Gulf Coast yucca, Texas bullnettle (Cnidosolus texanus), Noseburns (Tragia sp.), plains snakecotton (Froelichia floridana), and Louisiana nerveray (Tetragonotheca ludoviciana).

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii).

Ecological Site Concept
The Terrace ecological site has very deep soils on terrace landforms. These sites are located on a higher landform than bottomlands and are not as wet. The sites are situated on a lower landform than the uplands and are not as dry. The sites do not flood or pond. This unique position between the drier uplands and wetter bottomlands creates their plant community.

Soil Features
Alazan, Attoyac, and Bernaldo are representative soils of the Terraces. The Terraces can have a wide range of textures and depths. The grouping factor is, all are located on the terrace landform position. Besides the previously listed soils, these are correlated as well: Addielou, Annona, Austonio, Bearhead, Besner, Bistineau, Cadeville, Cart, Chireno, Eastham, Elysian, Erno, Forbing, Freestone, Gallime, Garner, Glenmora, Hallsbluff, Keiffer, Landman, Latch, Mckamie, Moten, Multey, Raino, Shatta, Spurger, Timpson, Vesey, Waskom, and Woden.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis).

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Upland site is unique by its upland position on the landscape, while also having a seasonally high water table. Clay soils in the subhorizons cause water to stay in the profile for long periods of time, especially from November to May. Not only does the water table affect the plants, but many of the soils are shallow with their depth to bedrock as low as 16 inches.

Soil Features
The soils consist of shallow to very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed from mudstone residuum. The representative soils are: Alusa, Anacoco, Browndell, Colita, Corrigan, Elmina, Felker, Fetzer, Gomery, Kolin, Libuse, Lummus, Metcalf, Tiak, and Wiergate. They are widely varying taxonomically, from alfisols to ultisols to vertisols. Their unifying factor is their upland position with a fluctuating water table. Many of the soils have restrictions to bedrock, classifying them as shallow.

Reference Community
The varying degree of water availability and root restriction cause the understory sites to be highly variable. Common understory species include: longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), sedges (Carex sp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and Texas ironweed (Vernonia texana). Common shrub species include: American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Seasonally Wet Upland site is unique by its upland position on the landscape, while also having a seasonally high water table. Clay soils in the subhorizons cause water to stay in the profile for long periods of time, especially from November to May. Not only does the water table affect the plants, but many of the soils are shallow with their depth to bedrock as low as 16 inches.

Soil Features
The soils consist of shallow to very deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed from mudstone residuum. The representative soils are: Alusa, Anacoco, Browndell, Colita, Corrigan, Elmina, Felker, Fetzer, Gomery, Kolin, Libuse, Lummus, Metcalf, Tiak, and Wiergate. They are widely varying taxonomically, from alfisols to ultisols to vertisols. Their unifying factor is their upland position with a fluctuating water table. Many of the soils have restrictions to bedrock, classifying them as shallow.

Reference Community
The varying degree of water availability and root restriction cause the understory sites to be highly variable. Common understory species include: longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), sedges (Carex sp.), partridgeberry (Mitchella repens), and Texas ironweed (Vernonia texana). Common shrub species include: American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshallii), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium).

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium).

Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The ecological site has very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are occasionally flooded. The sites will typically stay flooded longest during the periods of November to May. Due to their coarse textured soils, the sites drain quicker and do not stay flooded as long as the loamy and clayey bottomlands sites. The drainage patterns and sandy soils create their unique plant community.

Soil Features
The ecological site formed from alluvium and is associated with very deep, somewhat poorly drained, entisols and inceptisols on bottomlands. These sites differ from the loamy and clayey bottomlands by having coarse textured, sandy soils. Their drainage is comparatively better and the soils do not stay as saturated as their other bottomland coutnerparts. Soils correlated to this site include: Henco, Kawah, Keechi, Lotus, Melhomes, Naconiche, Nugent, and Osier.

Ecological Site Concept
The Very Deep Sandy Uplands site has deep sandy soils greater than 80 inches with little horizon development. The upland landscape, coupled with properties associated with the depth of the sand, forms its unique plant community.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands throughout the entire soil profile, measured to 80 inches. Being entisols, below the A horizon, the B horizons are not well developed. They are instead characterized mainly by a change in color, not the typical clay accumulations of most other upland soils throughout the MLRA. The Tonkawa series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, excessively drained, permeable soils that formed in sandy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits of the Carizzo Sand, Queen City Sand, and Sparta Sand Formations. The series is classified as a Thermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamment. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep sands throughout all horizons. Besides the Tonkawa series, Darden and Duffern are included in the Very Deep Sandy Upland ecological site.

Reference Community
The Woodland phase (1.1) is the first community in the State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally sparse. The overstory canopy is not as dominated by shortleaf pine as the adjacently surrounding sites. Instead, the shortleaf is interspersed with post oak, blackjack oak, bluejack oak, and black hickory (Carya texana). The occurrence of either post oak or shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 10 and 50 percent. Bluejack oak and blackjack oak have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent, and black hickory ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. In most other ecological sites, oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Conversely, in the Very Deep Sandy Uplands, the pine layer and the oak layer are similar in height. The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Both communities are characterized by a sparse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Threeawn can occupy much of the ground cover, as they are considered first successional grasses. The lack of nutrients and water holding capactiy make colonization possible by species able to withstand the harsh conditions. Little bluestem (Schizachrium scoparium) and panic-grasses (Dichanthelium sp.) may be common, but not abundant. Indicator plants include Gulf Coast yucca, Texas bullnettle (Cnidosolus texanus), Noseburns (Tragia sp.), plains snakecotton (Froelichia floridana), and Louisiana nerveray (Tetragonotheca ludoviciana).

The willow oak community (1.1) represents the middle-relief elevation in comparison to communities 1.2 and 1.3. Plant species occurring in the willow oak community are usually facultative wet according to the U.S. Army Corps' Wetland Delineation Manual (2010). Understory indicators include blunt broom sedge (Carex tribuloides), smallspike false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and American Buckwheat vine (Brunnichia ovata).

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium).

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches. Besides the Briley series, Darbonne, Larue, Lilbert, Rentzel, Rosalie, Tenaha, Trep, and Wolfpen are correlated to the ecological site.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pine trees comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence in the overstory on any given site is between 75 to 100 percent. Blackjack and post oaks have established on some sites, comprising up to 20 percent of the overall canopy structure. Farkleberry, winged sumac (Rhus copallinum), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), sassafras (Sassafras albidium), and oak saplings are common in the mid-story layer, increasing in abundance with time since last fire. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with sometimes large accumulations of plant litter, 15 to 45 percent. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities, at times seemingly dominating the entire area.

Soils with similar growth potentials, limitations, and hazards are combined to show woodland, grazing, and wildlife suitability (WS). Woodland productivity is shown as site index (height dominant trees will grow in a specified number of years); cottonwood 30 years, sycamore 35 years, and all other species 50 years.
The woodland suitability group should not be confused with the woodland ordination symbol shown in the table, Woodland Management and Productivity. Although both the woodland suitability group symbol and the woodland ordination symbol are based upon site index, the symbols are different and do not correlate well with one another. Different methods were used to arrive at the symbols. The woodland ordination symbol was developed in 1985 to replace the older woodland suitability group.
The first part of the woodland suitability symbol, a number, indicates the potential productivity of the soils for important trees. The number 1 indicates very high productivity; 2, high; 3, moderate high; 4, moderate; and 5, low.
The second part of the symbol, a letter, indicates the major kind of soil limitation. The letter x indicates stoniness or rockiness; w, excessive water in or on the soil; t, toxic substances in the soil; d, restricted root depth; c, clay in the upper part of the soil; s, sandy texture; f, high content of coarse fragments in the soil profile; and r, steep slopes. The letter o indicates that limitations or restrictions are insignificant. If a soil has more than one limitation, the priority is as follows: x, w, t, d, c, s, f, and r.
The third part of the symbol, a numeral, indicates the kind of trees for which the soils are best suited and the severity of the hazard or limitation. The numerals 1, 2, and 3 indicate slight, moderate, and severe limitations, respectively, and suitability for needle leaf trees. The numerals 4, 5, and 6 indicate slight, moderate, and severe limitations, respectively, and suitability for broadleaf trees. The numerals 7, 8, and 9 indicate slight, moderate, and severe limitations, respectively, and suitability for both needle leaf and broadleaf trees.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Deep Sandy Terrace site has deep sandy soils with little horizon development. This, coupled with their position on terraces, form the unique plant communities.

Soil Features
The two representative soils are Bienville and Hainesville. Both are sandy and classified as psammentic paleudalfs and lamellic quartzipsamments, respectively. The deep sands exist through all the horizons. There is very little clay percent increase as depth increases. The soils drain somewhat excessively and their permeability is moderate to moderately rapid.

Reference Community
The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Ground cover is sparse and much of the surface is bare ground or covered by lichens. Common understory species include: little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern prickley pear (Opuntia humifosa), tapered rosette grass (Dichanthelium acuminatum), and Texas bullnettle (Cnidoscolus texana). Shrub species will be sparse as well, but include: yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum).

The Woodland phase (1.1) is the first community in the State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally sparse. The overstory canopy is not as dominated by shortleaf pine as the adjacently surrounding sites. Instead, the shortleaf is interspersed with post oak, blackjack oak, bluejack oak, and black hickory (Carya texana). The occurrence of either post oak or shortleaf pine in the overstory at any given site is between 10 and 50 percent. Bluejack oak and blackjack oak have established on the sites at 10 to 30 percent, and black hickory ranging from 0 to 10 percent of the overall canopy structure. In most other ecological sites, oak species typically only achieve half the height of pines leading to a two-layer canopy. Conversely, in the Very Deep Sandy Uplands, the pine layer and the oak layer are similar in height. The lack of clay in the soil profile reduces the amount of nutrients that can accumulate in the soil. The pine trees may also have a yellowish tint to their needles resulting from lack of nutrients. Both communities are characterized by a sparse ground layer with large patches of bare ground and litter. Threeawn can occupy much of the ground cover, as they are considered first successional grasses. The lack of nutrients and water holding capactiy make colonization possible by species able to withstand the harsh conditions. Little bluestem (Schizachrium scoparium) and panic-grasses (Dichanthelium sp.) may be common, but not abundant.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become more dense, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2. The infrequency of fire causes an accumulation of litter throughout the sites and bare ground is uncommon. The most dominant gramanoids are longleaf woodoats, slender woodoats (Chasmanthium laxum), and cypress swamp sedge (Carex joorii). The micro-lows are often colonized by broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus). Partridgeberry and Carolina elephanstfoot (Elephantopus carolinianus) are highly associated to the site.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Terrace sites are highly variable in their overstory composition. While white oak and loblolly pine are the dominant species, the overstory frequently has southern red oak, (Quercus falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) intermingled. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) may occur in the southern portions of the region. White oaks and/or loblolly pine may make up 75 percent of the overstory at any given time. The other hardwood and pine species make up the rest of the overstory. Shrubs are an important component in the ecological site. American beautyberry, yaupon, and possumhaw are dominant. Sassafras (Sassafras albidum), parsley hawthorn (Crataegus marshalii), and farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum) are common, but seen in lesser densities.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Uplands have very deep loamy soils greater than 80 inches. The ecological sites produce high amounts of plant biomass because of the loamy growing medium with nonrestrictive soil textures through the soil profiles with adequate water-holding capacity. The sites generally have the most robust plant communities of any adjacent sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by loams throughout the soil profile, measured to 80 inches. The soils belong to the alfisol and ultisol orders and have well developed horizons. The Bowie series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from Southern Coastal Plain marine deposits. The series is classified as a fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudult. Not all soils within the ecological site will have the same taxonomic classification, but produce similar vegetative communities. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by deep fine-loamy and fine-silty control sections. The soils included are well drained or moderately well drained. Soils that are moderately well drained have a general increase in clay in the lower horizons. Besides the Bowie series, the Alto, Beauregard, Blevins, Diboll, Elrose, Eylau, Fuller, Gunter, Keatchie, Keithville, Kullit, Latex, Oakwood, Olla, Penning, Rigolette, Rogan, Ruston, Saffell, Sailes, Sawlit, Sawtown, Sawyer, Scottsville, Smithdale, Ulto, and Warnock are correlated to the Loamy Uplands.

Reference Community
The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface.

Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well. The shrub-layer height and densities fluctuate with time since the last fire. Fire prunes their growth back and allows the understory grasses and forbs to stay diverse and abundant. The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

The Shortleaf Pine/Red Oak Woodland (1.1) is the first community in State 1. Litter accumulation is moderate and understory vegetation is naturally dense. The overstory canopy is dominated by shortleaf pine and red oaks, and are usually in higher densities (total basal area) than the adjacently surrounding upland sites. The overstory canopy can also be interspersed with post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), white oak (Quercus alba), and black hickory (Carya texana). The sites can be dominated by shortleaf pines, 100 percent canopy cover, but range as low as 60 percent with the oak and hickories comprising the rest of the overstory. Given time to mature, the sites produce tall, straight overstory pines which can reach heights above 100 feet. This community is characterized by a dense ground layer with relatively no bare ground (less than 5 percent). Needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) is a highly abundant grass throughout the herbaceous understory. Other grasses seen, though not as dominant are longleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum), variable panicgrass (Dichanthelium commutatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Forbs occupying the site include flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), hairy small-leaf ticktrefoil (Desmodium ciliare), and downy milkpea (Galactia volubilis). The shrub layer of the community is very conspicuous, containing numerous American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria).

The shrub-layer is the main driver between communities 1.1 and 1.2. As the shrubs begin to grow above 4.5 feet and become denser, the community moves along the pathway from 1.1 to 1.2.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Over Clayey Uplands have loamy-surfaced soils to about 10 inches and a thick layer of clay subsurface soils underneath. The properties associated with uplands and clayey soils form the unique plant community of these sites.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderate to deep and characterized by a thick Bt layer of clay just below a fine sandy loam surface. The Kirvin series is representative and consists of well drained soils. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in weakly consolidated and stratified loamy, sandy, and clayey fluvial marine deposits on uplands of the Claiborne geological group. The series is classified as a fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult. Other soils are included with the ecological site and all are defined by a thick clay subsurface soil below the surface. Besides the Kirvin series, these soils are correlated: Angie, Arriola, Bayoudan, Bellwood, Bonwier, Bryarly, Bub, Burkeville, Conroe, Cuthbert, Darley, Eastwood, Etoile, Galilee, Gore, Hornbeck, Huntsburg, Lacerda, Maben, Mahan, Meth, Naclina, Nacogdoches, Natchitoches, Newco, Nikful, Oula, Raylake, Redco, Redsprings, Rosenwall, Ruple, Sacul, Sugartown, Tahoula, Trawick, and Woodtell.

Reference Community
Shortleaf pines comprise the majority of the overstory. Shortleaf occurrence of the total overstory on any given site is between 75 and 100 percent. Post oaks are usually found on the site as well. Post oaks range from 0 to 25 percent of the total overstory canopy. Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), black hickory (Carya texana), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata) are occasionally seen in the overstory and add to the diversity of the site. Along with American beautyberry, yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) , and rusty blackhaw (Vibrunum rufidulum) are usually associated with the sites as well.

Ecological Site Concept
The Northern Sandy Loam Uplands site has a sandy or loamy surface soil with a gradual increase in clay through the subsurface horizons. The gradual increase in clay content aids in moisture retention, allowing the formation of a well-developed vegetative community. The ecological site has more biomass development than the deep sandy uplands, sometimes located adjacently upslope, and a more open canopy than the adjacent clayey uplands, located downslope.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are deep and characterized by sands through the A and E profiles. The Bt layer is generally a sandy clay loam occurring between 20 and 40 inches continuing through the lower profiles of the soil. The Briley series is a representative soil and consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy Coastal Plain sediments. The series is classified as a loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Paleudult. Other soils are included within the ecological site and all are defined by their upper horizons of sands and presence of an argillic between 20 and 40 inches. Besides the Briley series, Darbonne, Larue, Lilbert, Rentzel, Rosalie, Tenaha, Trep, and Wolfpen are correlated to the ecological site.

Shortleaf pine trees comprise the majority of the overstory. The occurrence in the overstory on any given site is between 75 to 100 percent. Blackjack and post oaks have established on some sites, comprising up to 20 percent of the overall canopy structure. Farkleberry, winged sumac (Rhus copallinum), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), sassafras (Sassafras albidium), and oak saplings are common in the mid-story layer, increasing in abundance with time since last fire. Both communities are characterized by a diverse ground layer with sometimes large accumulations of plant litter, 15 to 45 percent. Little bluestem and needleleaf rosette grass (Dichanthelium aciculare) are the most abundant grasses seen in the two communities, at times seemingly dominating the entire area. Indicator forbs include Virginia tephrosia (Tephrosia virginiana), St. Andrew's cross (Hypericum hypericoides), Nuttall's wild indigo (Baptistia nuttalliana), and Atlanta pigeonwings (Clitoria mariana).
